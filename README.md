Log_Analyzer_For_Intrusion_Detection & Secure_File_Storage__System_With_AES
# Log Analyzer for Intrusion Detection

## Objective
Detect suspicious patterns such as brute-force attacks and scanning in SSH and Apache logs.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- re (regex)
- Sample logs (auth.log, access.log)

## Features
- Parses SSH and Apache logs
- Identifies brute-force attempts
- Detects invalid users and high-frequency access
- Visualizes top IPs using bar charts
- Cross-references with a public blacklist
- Exports incident reports in CSV and PNG format

## Folder Structure
- log_analyzer_project.zip

## Output
  CSV report with suspicious IPs
  PNG chart of top attackers
